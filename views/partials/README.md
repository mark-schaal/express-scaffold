# View Partials

All view partials will be categorized into either "global" or "non-global" groups, with respect to folder structure.

**Global Partials** will be any partial implemented consistently across multiple layout templates or views. (e.g. headers, footers)

**Non-global Partials** will be any partial not implemented consistently across multiple layout templates or views.
